					<p>Flax is a statically-and-strongly-typed programming language that aims to combine the power of C++ with the simplicity of C. I know, what an irony.</p>

					<p>It is a low-level, general-purpose language offering pointer and memory manipulation, while having high-level constructs like memory-managed (through automatic reference counting) strings, generic types and functions, object-orientation, and runtime type introspection.</p>

					<p>Currently the result of <em>3 years</em> of ongoing labour, and the product of several rewrites, Flax currently possesses these features:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Struct and Class types</li>
						<li>Function overloading</li>
						<li>Parametric types and functions</li>
						<li>First-class functions</li>
						<li>Operator overloading</li>
						<li>Traits / interfaces</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The low-level interface of Flax is not hindered by an obsessive borrow checker, but it is intentionally designed not to hand-hold programmers in their work. Some deeper level of semantic analysis might be added in the future, but purely as a <em>suggestion</em> to the user.</p>

					<p>Memory safety is a good thing, but it should not come at the cost of programmer productivity.</p>

					<p>[mx] started its life way back in 2011 with a name lost to the depths of time, as an ill-conceived foray into the field of kernel programming. The spirit of that initial leap survives in [mx] as the fifth iteration of the project.</p>

					<p>Before abandonment due to instability, it boasted several features that would work intermittently and often mutually exclusive of each other:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pre-emptive multitasking</li>
						<li>Executable loading (static linking only)</li>
						<li>Ring-3 userspace with homegrown libc</li>
						<li>Basic self-rolled TCP/IP network stack</li>
						<li>ATA reading over DMA and PIO</li>
						<li>FAT32 read support</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Unfortunately, I could never really fix the heisenbugs that kept cropping up, and so development lost its inertia and slowed to a halt by the end of 2016.</p>

					<p>[mx] may be picked up again in the future, perhaps as a continuation or as a rewrite &mdash; who knows.</p>
